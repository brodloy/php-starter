# PHP Lite Starter

A deliberately small, **no-dependency** PHP 8 starter. One entry point, a tiny
router, plain-PHP views, and a thin safe wrapper around the database. It keeps
the security that matters (prepared statements, CSRF, argon2id passwords,
sessions, security headers) but stays close to a classic
"dispatcher → controller → view" layout you can hold in your head.

- **No Composer, no dependencies.** A 6-line autoloader loads your classes. Clone, configure, run.
- **No namespaces.** Classes are global — add a file under `app/`, use it anywhere.
- **A new page is one route line + one method.** SQL is written right in the controller, where you can see it.

## What's where (the whole map)

```
php-lite/
├─ public/
│  ├─ index.php        ← THE front door. Every request starts here.
│  ├─ .htaccess        ← rewrites all URLs to index.php
│  └─ assets/          ← app.css (the look) + app.js
├─ routes.php          ← THE url map. Add a page = add a line here.
├─ console             ← CLI: migrations, seeding, cleanup  (php console …)
├─ bootstrap.php       ← startup: autoloader, config, session, errors
├─ config.php          ← your local settings (copied from config.example.php)
├─ app/
│  ├─ helpers.php      ← global functions: e(), view(), db(), auth(), redirect()…
│  ├─ Router.php       ← matches a URL to a controller method
│  ├─ Database.php     ← db() — safe PDO wrapper (you write the SQL)
│  ├─ Auth.php         ← auth() — login, register, remember-me, verification, OAuth
│  └─ Controllers/     ← one class per area (Home, Auth, Dashboard, Example, Admin, Upload, Api, GoogleAuth)
├─ views/              ← plain PHP templates (layouts, partials, pages)
├─ database/
│  ├─ migrations/      ← numbered .sql files, run in order
│  └─ seed.sql         ← demo data
├─ storage/
│  ├─ logs/            ← app.log + mail.log
│  └─ uploads/         ← uploaded files (outside public/, never web-served)
└─ tests.php           ← `php tests.php`
```

**Where do I look when something's wrong?**

| Symptom | Look here |
|---|---|
| URL gives 404 | `routes.php` (is the route declared? right order?) |
| Page logic wrong | the controller method in `app/Controllers/` |
| Page looks wrong | the view in `views/` |
| Data wrong | the SQL — it's right there in the controller method |
| Error / blank page | `storage/logs/app.log` |
| Login behaving oddly | `app/Auth.php` |

## Setup (MAMP / WAMP)

You need **PHP 8.2+** and **MySQL** — both come with MAMP/WAMP. No Composer.

1. **Copy the config:** `cp config.example.php config.php`
   (a ready `config.php` with MAMP defaults is already included, so on MAMP you can skip this.)
2. **Check the DB settings** in `config.php`. MAMP uses port **8889** / `root`/`root`
   (already set). WAMP/standard MySQL uses **3306**.
3. **Create an empty database** called `lite` (utf8mb4) in phpMyAdmin.
4. **Build the tables and demo data** — from the project root:
   ```bash
   php console db:install
   ```
   (No CLI handy? In phpMyAdmin, import each file in `database/migrations/` in
   number order, then `database/seed.sql`.)
5. **Serve the `public/` folder:**
   - Easiest: `php -S localhost:8000 -t public`, then open `http://localhost:8000`
   - Or point MAMP/WAMP's document root at this project's **`public/`** folder.

**Logins (from the seed):**
`demo@example.com` / `password` · `admin@example.com` / `password`

Password reset and email verification need **no email setup** locally — the
messages (with links) are written to `storage/logs/mail.log`. Open it and copy the link.

> **Important:** the web server's document root must be `public/`, never the
> project root. Everything sensitive lives outside `public/`. If the page loads
> unstyled, the doc root is wrong — see the deploy notes below.

---

## The CLI

```bash
php console db:migrate          # run any new migrations
php console db:install          # migrate, then load demo data
php console db:install --fresh  # DROP all tables, then migrate + seed (DEV ONLY)
php console db:seed             # load demo data
php console db:cleanup          # prune expired tokens + old login attempts
```

**Changing the schema later** is the migration workflow: add the next numbered
file in `database/migrations/` (e.g. `009_add_widget_table.sql`) and run
`php console db:migrate`. Each file runs once and is recorded, so migrate only
ever runs the new ones.

**Cron:** schedule `php console db:cleanup` daily, e.g.
`0 3 * * * cd /path/to/app && php console db:cleanup`.

## How to add a new section (e.g. "Widgets")

Three steps.

**1. Add routes** in `routes.php` (mirror the Examples block; declare
`/widgets/create` *before* `/widgets/{id}`):

```php
$router->get('/widgets',            [WidgetController::class, 'index']);
$router->get('/widgets/create',     [WidgetController::class, 'create']);
$router->post('/widgets',           [WidgetController::class, 'store']);
$router->get('/widgets/{id}',       [WidgetController::class, 'show']);
$router->get('/widgets/{id}/edit',  [WidgetController::class, 'edit']);
$router->post('/widgets/{id}',      [WidgetController::class, 'update']);
$router->post('/widgets/{id}/delete', [WidgetController::class, 'destroy']);
```

**2. Create the controller** `app/Controllers/WidgetController.php` — copy
`ExampleController.php` and rename. The shape of one method:

```php
public function index(): string
{
    require_login();
    $result = db()->paginate('Widget', 'WHERE `FK_UserID` = ?',
        [current_user()['PK_UserID']], max(1, (int) input('page', '1')), 10, 'ORDER BY `CreatedAt` DESC');
    return view('widgets/index', ['title' => 'Widgets', 'result' => $result], 'app');
}
```

**3. Create the views** in `views/widgets/` — copy from `views/examples/`.

**4. Add a migration** `database/migrations/009_create_widget.sql`, run `php console db:migrate`.

That's the loop. No model class, no repository — the SQL lives in the method.

## What's included beyond the basics

- **Account settings** — `/settings`: the logged-in user can change their name,
  email, and password (current password required).
- **Per-field form validation** — controllers collect `['field' => 'message']`
  errors and `redirect_errors()` back to the form; views show each message
  under its input with `field_error('name')` + `invalid_class('name')`. Used by
  register, settings, and the Example form — copy that pattern for your forms.
- **Auth:** email/password (argon2id), rate-limited login, **remember me**,
  **email verification** (banner + resend; links go to `mail.log` locally),
  password reset.
- **Optional Google sign-in** — set `google_enabled => true` in `config.php`
  with your client id/secret (redirect URI `{app_url}/auth/google/callback`).
  Off by default; when off the button hides and the routes 404.
- **Roles** — `require_admin()` gates a page; demo admin user list at `/admin/users`.
- **File uploads** — `/uploads`: validated, stored outside `public/`, streamed
  back through an ownership-checked route (never a guessable URL).
- **Pagination** — `db()->paginate(...)` + `pagination_links(...)`.
- **JSON API** — `json()` helper; demo at `/api/examples` (session-authed).
- **Dates** — `format_date()` shows UTC values in your `config('timezone')`.
- **Migrations + CLI**, a styled 500 page, and `db:cleanup` for cron.

## The handful of rules that keep it safe

1. **Print dynamic values with `e()`** — `<?= e($row['Title']) ?>`. Stops XSS.
2. **Pass values as params, never paste into SQL** — `db()->all('… WHERE x = ?', [$x])`. Stops SQL injection.
3. **Put `<?= csrf_field() ?>` in every `<form>`.** The router rejects any POST without it.
4. **Scope queries to the user** — `WHERE FK_UserID = ?` — and call `require_login()` (or `require_admin()`) on protected pages.

---

## Going to production

- In `config.php`: set `debug => false`, a real `app_url` (https), real DB creds,
  and `mail_driver => 'mail'` (or wire up a real mailer).
- Serve over **HTTPS** (session + remember-me cookies switch to `secure` automatically).
- Point the document root at **`public/`**.
- Ensure `storage/logs/` and `storage/uploads/` are writable by the web server.
- Run `php console db:migrate` on deploy; schedule `db:cleanup` via cron.

**Can't set the document root** (some cheap shared hosts)? Drop this `.htaccess`
in the project root to funnel requests into `public/`:

```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^$ public/ [L]
RewriteRule (.*) public/$1 [L]
```

Pointing the doc root at `public/` is still preferred — this is the fallback.

## Commands

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public   # run it
php console db:install            # set up the database + demo data
php tests.php                     # run the tiny test suite
```

## When to move on

When you outgrow this — multiple developers, lots of related tables, queues,
billing — that's the time for the structured "full" starter or a framework like
Laravel. Building on this first is the best way to understand what those bigger
tools do for you.
